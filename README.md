# altswitch
Altswitch is a blockchain-based company that aims to empower individuals and businesses with the power of ownership through decentralized technology. Our vision is to create a more secure, transparent, and accessible cross-border world. We have developed a decentralized ecosystem of services and apps, including a wallet infrastructure tailored for enterprise experiences, while staying decentralized with better security and taking self-custody of their assets. Our native token, ALTX, is designed with a hard-coded decentralized rebate system, offering an exclusive benefit to holders and enterprises within our ecosystem.
We are addressing the growing market for cross-border payments via cryptocurrency, which amount to roughly $700 billion according to the latest available data. This is only a tiny fraction of the $156t in cross-border payments made globally through traditional financial vehicles with B2B transactions contributing $150t to date. Additionally, the global cryptocurrency market size is projected to grow from USD 910.3 million in 2021 to USD 1,902.5 million in 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 11.1% during the 2021-2028 period. We are focused on helping businesses such as e-commerce, freelancers, and other entities that wish to enable cross-border transactions.
